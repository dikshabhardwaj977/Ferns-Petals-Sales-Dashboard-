# Ferns & Petals Sales Dashboard
# Excel Dashboard
**Project Overview:** To develop a comprehensive sales dashboard using Excel that addresses key business questions, such as total revenue, top products, 
                  customer spending, and product performance across different occasions and locations.
**Steps Taken:**
1) Analyzed 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐫, 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬, and 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 across various occasions using 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲, 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐭, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬.
2) After the analysis, I built an 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 by linking 𝐏𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐭𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬 - making it easy to interpret the data dynamically.
3) The Key Insights it was able to produce were: 
    • An average of 𝟏,𝟎𝟎𝟎 𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 generated ₹𝟑𝟓,𝟐𝟎,𝟗𝟖𝟒 in revenue.
    • 𝐀𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 and 𝐑𝐚𝐤𝐬𝐡𝐚 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐡𝐚𝐧 were top-performing occasions.
    • High-performing months were 𝐅𝐞𝐛𝐫𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐲 and 𝐀𝐮𝐠𝐮𝐬𝐭.
    • Avg. Delivery Time: 𝟓.𝟓𝟑 days.
